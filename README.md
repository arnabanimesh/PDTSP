# Exponential-Size Neighborhoods for the Pickup-and-Delivery Traveling Salesman Problem

This is an implementation of the new neighborhood searches for one-to-one pickup-and-delivery problems. More precisely, we focus on the pickup-and-delivery traveling salesman problem (PDTSP), which is the canonical problem in this family [1].

Main project features:
* <b>Relocate-Pair</b> neighborhood: Enhanced implementation in O(n<sup>2</sup>) instead of O(n<sup>3</sup>) time.
* <b>2-Opt</b> neighborhood: Adaptation to the PDTSP.
* <b>Or-Opt</b> neighborhood: Adaptation to the PDTSP.
* <b>2k-Opt</b> neighborhood: New exponential-size neighborhood containing all solutions formed with nested 2-Opts and explored in O(n<sup>2</sup>) time.
* <b>4-Opt</b> neighborhood: Based on the concepts of Glover (1996) and adapted to the PDTSP.
* <b>Balas and Simonetti</b> neighborhood: Based on the concepts of Balas and Simonetti (2001) and adapted to the PDTSP.
* All these neighborhoods are integrated within the hybrid genetic search (HGS) of Vidal et al. (2012, 2014).
* We also provide a reimplementation of Veenstra et al. (2017) Ruin and Recreate algorithm, including an O(n<sup>2</sup>) reinsertion operator.

## Scope

This code has been designed to solve the Pickup-and-Delivery Traveling Salesman Problem (PDTSP).

This code version has been designed and calibrated for medium-scale instances with up to 1,000 customers.

## Compiling the executables 

You need [`CMake`](https://cmake.org) to compile.

Build with:
```console
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```
This will generate the executable file `pdphgs` and `pdprr` in the `build` directory.

## Running the algorithm

After building the executables, you can try an example of `pdphgs`: 
```console
./pdphgs --instance=../instances/RBO00/Class1/U159C.PDT --it=1000
```

The following options are supported: (default values are included in parentheses)

The main folders containing the logic of the algorithm are the following:
* **hgsadc**: Implementation of HGS with a generic problem and solution interface.

* **pdp/moves**: Generic interface for moves (PDPMoves), and individual classes with the implementations of the six neighborhoods: Relocate-Pair, 2-Opt, Or-Opt, 2k-Opt, Balas and Simonetti and 4-Opt.

In addition, additional classes have been created to facilitate interfacing:
* **Application**: Reads command line and stores the parameters of the algorithm.
* **random**: Utilities to initiate RNG and allow ranged sampling.
* **main**: Main code to start the algorithm

### Ruin and Recreate (./PDP-RR folder)

* **Application**: Reads command line and stores the parameters of the algorithm.
* **Instance**: Reads instance file and stores precompute distances.
